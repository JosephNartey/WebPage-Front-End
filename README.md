# WebPage-Front-End
In this project I wrote an html5 discription of a webpage while using css to style out the basic components.
JavaScript was implemented for authentication purposes. 
Some features of the webpage include forms, sign up buttons and links to other webpages and can be remodified and used in bigger projects.
